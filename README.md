# Generative AI on Amazon SageMaker and Amazon Bedrock

This repository provides comprehensive resources for working with generative AI models using Amazon SageMaker and Amazon Bedrock. Whether you're looking to fine-tune foundation models, build RAG applications, create agents, or implement responsible AI practices, you'll find practical examples and workshops here.

## Repository Structure

### Workshops

#### [Building RAG Workflows with SageMaker and Bedrock](./workshops/building-rag-workflows-with-sagemaker-and-bedrock/)
- Build experimental RAG applications
- Implement RAG with SageMaker and OpenSearch
- Fine-tune embedding models
- Customize models with RAFT
- Apply guardrails to LLM outputs

#### [Distributed Training and Deployment on SageMaker AI](./workshops/distributed-training-deployment-on-sagemaker-ai/)
- Use SageMaker JumpStart for fine-tuning
- Implement distributed training with FSDP and QLoRA
