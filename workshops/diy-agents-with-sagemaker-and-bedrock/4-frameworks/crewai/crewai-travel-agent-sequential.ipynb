    "## (Optional) Prerequisite knowledge\n",
    "This section provides general information on agents, multi-agent collaboration, and other topics. If you are comfortable with these concepts, feel free to skip reading this section. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What is an LLM and what do the parameters mean?\n",
    "[Large language models](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/large-language-model/), also known as LLMs, are very large deep learning models that are pre-trained on vast amounts of data. LLMs are incredibly flexible. One model can perform completely different tasks such as answering questions, summarizing documents, translating languages and completing sentences. While not perfect, LLMs are demonstrating a remarkable ability to make predictions based on a relatively small number of prompts or inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can interact with LLMs through prompts. A prompt is a natural language text that requests the LLM to perform a specific task. Even though LLM attempts to mimic humans, it requires detailed instructions to create high-quality and relevant output. In [prompt engineering](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/prompt-engineering/), you choose the most appropriate formats, phrases, words, and symbols that guide the AI to interact with your users more meaningfully. Prompt engineers use creativity plus trial and error to create a collection of input texts, so an application's model works as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to prompts, you can influence LLM behavior through [inference parameters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/inference-parameters.html). Every model has different inference parameters, but a common parameter is `temperature`. It affects the shape of the probability distribution for the predicted output and influences the likelihood of the model selecting lower-probability outputs. A lower temperature leads to more deterministic responses which is useful for classification and structured output. A higher temperature leads to more random responses which is useful for use cases requiring natural, human-sounding, and creative output. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What is an agent and why should I use build one?\n",
    "An [artificial intelligence (AI) agent](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/ai-agents/) is a software program that can interact with its environment, collect data, and use the data to perform self-determined tasks to meet predetermined goals. Humans set goals, but an AI agent independently chooses the best actions it needs to perform to achieve those goals. Alternatively, the term agent is used to refer to an LLM workflow which is orchestrated to follow pre-defined tasks and paths. Agents can be given access to tools, such as calculators, APIs, or databases, to complete the tasks they have been given. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why should I use multiple agents to build a solution?\n",
    "Large language model (LLM) based AI agents that have been specialized for specific tasks have demonstrated great problem-solving capabilities. By combining the reasoning power of multiple intelligent specialized agents, multi-agent collaboration has emerged as a powerful approach to tackle more intricate, multistep workflows. Multi-agent collaboration offers several key advantages over single-agent approaches, primarily stemming from distributed problem-solving and specialization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Distributed problem-solving refers to the ability to break down complex tasks into smaller subtasks that can be handled by specialized agents. By breaking down tasks, each agent can focus on a specific aspect of the problem, leading to more efficient and effective problem-solving. For example, a travel planning problem can be decomposed into subtasks such as checking weather forecasts, finding available hotels, and selecting the best routes. The distributed aspect also contributes to the extensibility and robustness of the system. As the scope of a problem increases, we can simply add more agents to extend the capability of the system rather than try to optimize a monolithic agent packed with instructions and tools. On robustness, the system can be more resilient to failures because multiple agents can compensate for and even potentially correct errors produced by a single agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specialization allows each agent to focus on a specific area within the problem domain. For example, in a network of agents working on software development, a coordinator agent can manage overall planning, a programming agent can generate correct code and test cases, and a code review agent can provide constructive feedback on the generated code. Each agent can be designed and customized to excel at a specific task. \n",
    "For developers building agents, this means the workload of designing and implementing an agentic system can be organically distributed, leading to faster development cycles and better quality. Within enterprises, often development teams have distributed expertise that is ideal for developing specialist agents. Such specialist agents can be further reused by other teams across the entire organization."

With careful prompting it is possible to call a tool with DeepSeek R1, but we recommend choosing the right model for the right job. For example, **Meta Llama 3.1 70B Instruct** is better at tool calling, so we will use it for the research agent. Although you can deploy Meta Llama models on SageMaker endpoints, let's try using Llama via Amazon Bedrock serverless endpoints instead."
