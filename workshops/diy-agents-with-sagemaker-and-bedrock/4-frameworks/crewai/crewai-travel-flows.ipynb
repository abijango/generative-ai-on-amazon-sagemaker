    "# Agentic Workflows with CrewAI Flows\n",
    "\n",
    "CrewAI Flows is a feature designed to streamline the creation and management of AI workflows. Flows allow developers to combine and coordinate coding tasks and Crews efficiently, providing a robust framework for building sophisticated AI automations. You can start easily by leveraging two decorators, `@start()` and `@listen()`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `@start()`: the `@start()` decorator is used to mark a method as the starting point of a Flow; when a Flow is started, all the methods decorated with `@start()` are executed in parallel. You can have multiple start methods in a Flow, and they will all be executed when the Flow is started.\n",
    "- `@listen()`: the `@listen()` decorator is used to mark a method as a listener for the output of another task in the Flow. The method decorated with `@listen()` will be executed when the specified task emits an output. The method can access the output of the task it is listening to as an argument. The `@listen()` decorator can be used in several ways:\n",
    "    - Listening to a Method by Name: You can pass the name of the method you want to listen to as a string. When that method completes, the listener method will be triggered.\n",
    "    - Listening to a Method Directly: You can pass the method itself. When that method completes, the listener method will be triggered.â€‹"
