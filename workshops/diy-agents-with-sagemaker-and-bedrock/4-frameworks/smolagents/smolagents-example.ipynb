    "# Building Autonomous Agents with smolagents\n",
    "\n",
    "[ðŸ¤— smolagents](https://huggingface.co/blog/smolagents) is a library by Hugging Face that enables you to run powerful agents in a few lines of code. It is based on the concept of CodeAct Agents ([arXiv:2402.01030](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01030)), i.e. agents that write their actions in code. In a multi-step agent, at each step, the LLM can write an action, in the form of some calls to external tools. A common format for writing these actions is generally different shades of \"writing actions as a JSON of tools names and arguments to use, which you then parse to know which tool to execute and with which arguments\". To make it secure, it supports executing in sandboxed environments. Multiple research papers have shown that having the tool calling LLMs in code is much better.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we will highlight how we can use a multi agent framework with tools to find the most downloaded model of a given task on the Hugging Face Hub. \n",
    "\n",
    "smolagents supports any LLM via LiteLLM integration. To use smolagents, we are going to leverage the LiteLLM implementation which allows us to use both Amazon Bedrock and Amazon SageMaker AI, according to our preferences:"

    "Agents with smolagents can be easily created via two classes, `CodeAgent` and `ToolCallingAgent`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **CodeAgent** generates executable Python code snippets, enabling complex logic and variable handling for tasks requiring multi-step operations or data manipulation; \n",
    "- **ToolCallingAgent** employs standardized JSON structures to define tool calls, aligning with common LLM provider implementations for simpler, structured interactions. \n",
    "\n",
    "According to `smolagents` developers, CodeAgents typically achieve better performance on complex benchmarks due to their code-first flexibility, while ToolCallingAgents suit systems prioritizing interoperability with existing tool-calling protocols. Both agent types share the same multi-step workflow but differ fundamentally in action representation and execution security considerations."
