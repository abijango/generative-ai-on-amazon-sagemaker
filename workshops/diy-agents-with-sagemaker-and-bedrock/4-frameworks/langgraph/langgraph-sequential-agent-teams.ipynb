    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**LangGraph** is an extension of LangChain that provides a framework for building stateful, multi-agent applications. This notebook demonstrates how to create a travel assistant using multi-agent collaboration with LangGraph. Specifically, you will use this assistant to generate articles on the top activities and attractions for a specific location.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Estimated completion time:** 30-45 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will:\n",
    "1. Understand how to create and connect multiple agents in a sequential workflow\n",
    "2. Learn how to define agent roles and responsibilities\n",
    "3. Implement a multi-agent system that can research, write, and edit travel content\n",
    "4. Enhance agent capabilities by integrating external tools\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure of the Travel Assistant\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides step-by-step guidance for creating a travel assistant consisting of the following agents:\n",
