    "## Orchestrator-Workers Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the orchestrator-workers workflow, where a central LLM dynamically breaks down tasks, delegates them to worker LLMs, and synthesizes their results. This creates a flexible system that can adapt its approach based on the specific requirements of each task.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to use this workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "This workflow is well-suited for complex tasks where you can't predict the subtasks needed. The key difference from simple parallelization is its flexibility—subtasks aren't pre-defined, but determined by the orchestrator based on the specific input.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples where this workflow is useful\n",
