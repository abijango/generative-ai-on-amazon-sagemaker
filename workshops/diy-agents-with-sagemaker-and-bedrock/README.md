Welcome to the "Building AI Agents with Amazon Bedrock and Amazon SageMaker AI" workshop! This publicly available, hands-on experience is designed for builders who are ready to harness the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) and create autonomous AI agents on AWS.

In this workshop, you'll dive into the world of AI agents, learning how to leverage AWS services to build AI systems that can act independently, make decisions, and complete complex tasks with minimal human intervention.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this workshop, you'll be able to:

- Understand and implement foundational LLM patterns with tools and retrieval
- Build effective agentic workflows using proven patterns
- Create autonomous agent systems for complex tasks
- Choose and implement appropriate frameworks for your use case
- Monitor and optimize your AI agent systems
- Apply these patterns to real-world industry use cases

## Workshop Content

1. **Foundation Building**: Build your autonomous agents and agentic workflows from scratch
2. **Framework Exploration**: Learn one or more open-source frameworks for Agentic AI (crew.AI, langgraph, smolagents, etc)
3. **Advanced Topics**: Deep dive on observability/tracing, guardrails, evaluation
4. **Production Deployment**: Productionize agentic AI on AWS
5. **Real-world Applications**: Advanced use cases (MCP client/server on AWS, Natural Language 2 SQL, etc)

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of Python programming
- Familiarity with AWS services (especially Amazon Bedrock and Amazon SageMaker)
- AWS account with appropriate permissions
- Basic knowledge of machine learning concepts

## How to Run the Workshop

This workshop follows a hands-on, self-paced format. Each module contains Jupyter notebooks that you'll run in your own JupyterLab environment. The notebooks include:

- Step-by-step instructions and explanations
- Code samples that you can run and modify
- Exercises to reinforce your learning
- Links to additional resources

## Getting Started

1. Follow the setup instructions in the Workshop Studio link above
2. Clone this repository to your local environment or SageMaker instance
3. Navigate to the appropriate module directory
4. Open and run the Jupyter notebooks in sequence

## AWS Services Used

[Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock) and [Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker-ai) for model provisioning.
